# YMH-hackathon
A platform named Mindful Meet that aims at providing aid for people suffering through anxiety or depression. It first aims at creating a community of people suffering through similar problems based on presenting a question bank at the start. There will also be a chatbot which would provide answers to any question or problem asked by the user. Hence, users can talk either to other users or to the chatbot. Later interested users can also take online counselling sessions from trained counsellors as people may be hesitant to visit any counsellor publicly to avoid letting anyone else to know about their problem. These sessions can be taken both via a voice or a video call. These sessions would be provided at a very nominal rate as compared to the market prices.
